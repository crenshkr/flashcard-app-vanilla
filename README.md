# Randy's Starter Webpage

This is Randy's starter webpage. It's a great way to get things up and running quickly.

The intent is for this to be a starting point to make a basic webpage or webapp from scratch. No frills, no 3rd party libraries, but set up with all basics so you can jump right in without the annoying set-up time.

Get crackin'!

(Don't forget to change the metadata and Document title ya dingus!
