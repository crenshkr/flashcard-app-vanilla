    <h1>Randy's Starter Webpage</h1>
    <p>
      This is Randy's starter webpage. It's a great way to get things up and
      running quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intent is for this to be a starting point to make a basic webpage or
      webapp from scratch. No frills, no 3rd party libraries, but set up with
      all basics so you can jump right in without the annoying set-up time.
